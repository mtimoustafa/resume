# jsonresume-theme-breeze (WIP)
A breezy theme for the JSON Resume standard üçÉ

## To-Do
* Use headless Chromium for Puppeteer instead of the default Chromium build
* Actually support JSON Resume hosting API
* Validate JSON against JSON Resume schema ([e.g.](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema))
* Cleanup FontAwesome assets to include only the icons used
* Switch to a lightweight component library instead of jsonresume's Handlebars
