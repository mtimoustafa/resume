# Resume
My personal resume, built upon the JSON Resume standard. Available at [resume.fairewinds.ca](https://resume.fairewinds.ca).

## To-Do List
* Use headless Chromium for Puppeteer instead of the default Chromium build
* Automatically validate JSON against JSON Resume schema ([e.g. here](https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-schema))
* Cleanup FontAwesome assets to include only the icons used
* Switch to a lightweight component library instead of jsonresume's Handlebars
